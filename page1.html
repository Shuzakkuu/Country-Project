        <p>
            The Hagia Sophia, located in Instanbul, was originally created as a basilica for the Roman Emperor Justinian I in the sixth century. 
            Featuring a massive dome, which for over 1000 years had the largest enclosed indoor space. It was looted by the fourth crusaders 
            in 1204 and converted into a mosque when the Ottomans conquered the city. Currently it is a museum and one of the most popular tourist attractions in turkey.
