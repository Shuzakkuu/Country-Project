        <p>
            Hattusa is a remarkable ancient civilization, with the remnants of the Hittite capital dating back to the bronze age, around 2000BC.
            The capital was only fairly recently discovered in 1834, and before its excavation was only believed to be myth.
            The site is renowned for it extensive urbanization and advanced architecture including huge walls, intricately carved gates, and over 100 towers and additional walls to divide the city into districts.
